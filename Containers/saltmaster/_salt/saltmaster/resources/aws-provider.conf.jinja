  # This one should NOT be specified if VPC was not configured in AWS to be

  # Configure which user to use to run the deploy script. This setting is
  # dependent upon the AMI that is used to deploy. It is usually safer to
  # configure this individually in a profile, than globally. Typical users
  # are:
  #
  # Amazon Linux -> ec2-user
  # RHEL         -> ec2-user
  # CentOS       -> ec2-user
  # Ubuntu       -> ubuntu
  #
  ssh_username: ubuntu

  # Optionally add an IAM profile
  #iam_profile: 'my other profile name'
